## 8px Grid

We make use of a 8px grid system, which means all the spacings and columns are a divisible by eight.

The maximum columns are 12 with a fixed container width of 1110px.

The grid should scale according the the viewport size and should be able to scale from mobile to desktop.

<strong>
    Note: If you see a value in Figma that's not divisible by 8 (so 15px for example), please check with the designers.
